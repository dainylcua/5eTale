# 5eTale
*An undertale themed D&amp;D 5e Homebrew Item Database application*

## Purpose

5eTale aims to create an easily accessible D&amp;D 5e homebrew CRUD app that gives users and app developers a smooth experience for integrating custom items in their campaigns. Eventually, I plan to integrate this app and my previous app, [DungeonSheet](https://github.com/dainylcua/dungeon-sheet), into one unified experience for both veterans and rookies.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* JQuery
* MongoDB
* Express
* Node.js
* Heroku
* Bulma (CSS)

*Developed on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS*
